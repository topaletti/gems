# Gems of Europe

I browsed about twenty European stock exchanges for companies fulfilling certain criteria and wrote a short profile for each company with information from their website and annual report. For companies from certain countries (e.g. France, Netherlands, Belgium) I used a (formerly) free API to get their stock price histories, then put those histories into a Postgres database as JSON fields and used Django to programmatically transform them into SVG charts during the generation of the web page displaying the company list. The site could possibly be extended into a community platform with discussions about certain companies, but development is currently on hold. Also Heroku (where the app and its database were originally hosted) is shutting down its free services, so the app would have to be migrated to a different provider.
